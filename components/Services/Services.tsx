                            Therapy can be a space where you invest in yourselfâ€”one
                            of the highest forms of self-care.

                            You may be led to therapy by anxiety, depression,
                            relationship stress, past or recent trauma, grief and
                            loss, self-esteem issues, or challenges with family,
                            parenting, or parental relationships. Whatever the
                            source of your stress, you don&apos;t have to face it
                            alone. Therapy offers you the time and space to work
                            toward wellness and peace.
